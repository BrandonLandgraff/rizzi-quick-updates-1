With the ability to grow more than a meter a day, bamboo is a renewable resource that reaches maturity in 4-6 years or less; in sharp contrast, trees require decades (20 to 50 years) to recover from harvesting. Truly a wonder of nature, bamboo grows easily, even in environmentally stressed areas and unique settings like mountainsides and steep slopes, where other crops cannot. The plant thrives in depleted soil and when it is cut, the stem is left in the soil to sprout a new shoot and start the growing process again. Releasing 30% more oxygen into the atmosphere and absorbing more carbon dioxide in comparison to other plants, bamboo protects the environment as it grows and even helps to reduce soil erosion. Bamboo paper is recyclable. Just like paper made from wood pulp, bamboo paper can be recycled to lessen our impact on the environment and further reduce our reliance on trees and the catastrophic environmental effects of clear-cutting and deforestation. Overall, bamboo offers us strength, sustainability, versatility, and an environmentally responsible alternative. Some tree free products use fillers like sugar cane and recycled material or even virgin tree pulp fibers, No. 2 toilet paper is 100% bamboo.<\/p>"}},"b7c41d42-b739-4fde-b25e-4628541b9bab":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"title":"WHY IS BAMBOO TOILET PAPER SUSTAINABLE?","content":"<p><strong>Some fascinating and eye-opening facts:<\/strong><br\/>Americans consume 20% of the world's toilet paper.<br\/>Most toilet paper usage in the US comes from Canada, depleting their forests and causing devastating environmental damage.<br\/>By using bamboo toilet paper, you will save 384 trees in your lifetime.<br\/>Bamboo forests mature in 4 to 6 years versus the 20 to 50 years it takes for trees to recover from harvesting.<br\/>You have made a great decision to switch to not just 100% bamboo toilet paper, also to No.2 toilet paper.<br\/><br\/>Truly a wonder of nature, bamboo grows easily, even in environmentally stressed areas and unique settings like mountainsides and steep slopes, where other crops cannot.
